# Uni-Hub

The aim of our project is to create a multi-platform real time voice-chat application, setup similar to a podcast consisting of a set of speakers and listeners. Itâ€™s a drop-in audio chat which enables users to join in various audio rooms consisting of speakers, talking about a specific topic or agenda. The audio-rooms themselves are set up by the speakers and are classified by the topic happening inside, whereas the listeners traverse through a set of audio-rooms freely based on their preference without any kind of interruption to the room. A real time voice chat application. Built using Flutter framework (frontend), backend with Node.js, socket.io, express & mongodb. Uses agora api for realtime voice engagement.
